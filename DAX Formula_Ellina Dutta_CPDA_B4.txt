ORDER COUNT
Order_Count = COUNTROWS(Orders)


AVERAGE RISK SCORE
Avg_Risk_Score = AVERAGE(Suppliers[Risk_Score])


AVERAGE DELAY DAYS
Avg_Delay = AVERAGE(Shipments[Delay_Days])


AVERAGE RELIABILITY RATING
Avg_Reliability_Rating = AVERAGE(Suppliers[Reliability_Rating])


PERCENTAGE OF LATE SHIPMENTS
PCT_of_Late_Shipments = DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Shipments, Shipments[Status] = "Delayed")),
    COUNTROWS(Shipments)
)



COMPOSITE RISK SCORE
Composite_Risk_Score = 
0.4 * AVERAGE ( Suppliers[Risk_Score] ) +
0.3 * AVERAGE ( Shipments[Delay_Days] ) +
0.2 * DIVIDE (
        COUNTROWS ( FILTER ( Returns, Returns[Reason] = "Damaged Item" ) ),
        COUNTROWS ( Returns )
    ) +
0.1 * DIVIDE (
        COUNTROWS ( FILTER ( Warehouses, Warehouses[Stock_Level] < Warehouses[Min_Threshold] ) ),
        COUNTROWS ( Warehouses )
    )


STOCK STATUS
Stock_Status = 
IF( Warehouses[Stock_Level] < Warehouses[Min_Threshold], "Low Stock", "OK" )


DEBUGGING CHALLENGES
1.	Late Shipments Formula - Incorrect 
Wrong DAX
LateShipmentPct = COUNTROWS(Shipments[Status] = "Delayed") / COUNTROWS(Shipments)

Correct DAX
LateShipmentPct =
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Shipments, Shipments[Status] = "Delayed")),
    COUNTROWS(Shipments)
)




2.	Incorrect Relationship
Orders linked to Shipments via Warehouse_ID - This is wrong approach
Order and Shipment must be connected by Order_ID by One to Many Cardinality
