# GlobalLogix-Supplier-Risk-Management
Logistics Supplier Risk Analysis (Power BI): Built an interactive dashboard for a global logistics firm (GlobalLogiX) to identify high-risk suppliers, analyze shipment delays, inventory shortages, and return issues. Used DAX, slicers, filters, and visualization to uncover risks and propose corrective measures for business continuity.
# 🚚 Logistics Supplier Risk Management Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes supplier risks, shipment delays, inventory shortages, and returns for **GlobalLogiX**, a multinational logistics company.  
The goal is to identify vulnerabilities in the supply chain and recommend corrective measures through **interactive Power BI dashboards**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify **high-risk suppliers** with low reliability.
- Analyze **shipment delays** and their regional impact.
- Monitor **warehouse inventory levels** to prevent stock-outs.
- Investigate **returns** and root causes.
- Develop a **Composite Risk Score** using DAX to quantify overall supply chain risk.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- ⚠️ **Supplier Risks**: Avg Risk Score = 74.44; several suppliers flagged as high-risk.  
- 🚢 **Shipment Delays**: 20.5% shipments delayed, avg delay = 1.02 days (highest in China, India, UK).  
- 🏬 **Inventory Shortages**: 6 warehouses flagged with critically low stock.  
- 📦 **Returns**: Spread across Wrong Product, Quality Issues, Damaged Items, and Late Delivery.  
- 📈 **Composite Risk Score**: China & Germany marked as highest risk regions.

## 🚀 Business Recommendations
1. Prioritize mitigation for high-risk suppliers (Risk > 80, Reliability < 3).  
2. Implement quality checkpoints to reduce product/quality-related returns.  
3. Optimize logistics in **China, UK, India** to reduce shipment delays.  
4. Proactive inventory planning for low-stock warehouses.  
5. Track **Composite Risk Score** as a core KPI in ongoing monitoring.
